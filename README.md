Random Powershell Scripts
=========================
This repository contains various and arbitrary PowerShell scripts. Some of these I use regularly and are here so I can access them easily. Others are experiments that I may want to refer to in the future. Nothing in this repository has any guarantees to its functionality, stability, or quality.

Issues
------
If you notice a bug in one of the scripts feel free to open an issue for it, but unless you also provide a pull request to fix it don't expect a timely resolution. If it's not a bug I often run into personally, it's unlikely I'm going to spend time fixing it.

Feature Requests
----------------
In general, don't count on feature requests being implemented. If I think a request is something that I personally might find particularly useful I might entertain it, but otherwise what you see is what you get.

Contributions
-------------
You're welcome to submit pull requests for additional functionality or bug fixes if you like. I'll certainly consider merging them, and am happy to discuss any implementation details or concerns.
